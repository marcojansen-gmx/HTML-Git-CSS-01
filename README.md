# HTML-Git-CSS-01: Code Refactor

## The Task

**Note**: A webpage which was designed by another developer needs to be improved. 

In that process I will need to improve disability access to the page but also to fulfil requirents laid out by your tech lead. 

He has given me a small list of specific criteria to satisfy the project. These criteria are documented below in the "Acceptance Criteria" section.

In this process I will have to follow the **Scout Rule**, which recommends that you always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it.

Where possible I will also need to try to impress the client by improving the code base for long-term sustainability. 

For example, I will need to ensure that all links are functioning correctly. 

A rework of the CSS would also be recommended to make it more efficient. 

In this process I will consolidate CSS selectors and properties, organize them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements,
and include comments before each element or section of the page.


## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Review

To submit my review and results I will need to assure the following requirements.

* The URL of the deployed application will be submitted in time

* The URL of the GitHub repository will need to be made available for the instructors review. 

The repository needs a unique name and needs to include a README describing the project.
